# Enhancing Traditional Financial Models with Machine Learning Techniques and LLM's for deeper Insights

### Financial Models(With LLM): 
Created traditional DCF & Multiples Valuation Model to determine the intrinsic and relative value of companies. The LLM(Llama 3: 7B) gives summaries of the model and critics the assumptions of the model allowing for refinement of the model.

### Clustering Algorithm Enhancement: 
Integrated a clustering algorithm to refine Multiples Valuation Model, ensuring a precise selection of comparable companies.

### Sector Analysis: 
Developed a sector screener that applies some traditional statistical techniques to find out better performing sectors according to certain metrics. The LLM(Llama 3: 7B) then summarises the data and provides insight as to the best sectors for investment depending on your risk profile

### AI-Driven Insights: 
Each Model uses an LLM (Llama 3: 7B) to provide a summary and deeper insights on the model's outputs and assumptions.

# How to Run Locally
1. pip install all the libraries in the requiremets.txt file
2. run the webapp.py file
3. follow the instructions in the terminal
# Alternativly: Access Through website(No LLM Integration)
